# webq
---

- This is Django project so I don't want to split it.

- Django code are in "\webq\myproject\nonrelblog\views.py","\webq\myproject\nonrelblog\urls.py"

- Maybe you want to trace my code, there're in "\webq\myproject\nonrelblog\templates" and "\webq\myproject\nonrelblog\static"

note: I mainly write code in js and coffee 's folder.

javascript:app.js for mainPage map for querying from mongoDB  news.js for hotNews.html querying from mongoDB 

coffee: vis.js for hotNews word bubble
